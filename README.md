# **_Static_**

A very simple static website for my blog post.

### Prerequisites

* A computer

## Running the tests

Approach your cat, if it meows or purrs, give a treat. In any other case the test is considered failed.

**Edge cases**
* *I don't have a cat* - Open your fridge, if the light turns on, the test passes, otherwise it fails.
* *I don't have a fridge* - You are screwed. Test fails, no matter what.

## Deployment

Grab your mouse. Throw it to the wall. Now your website is up and running.

## Built With

* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - CSS Framework
* [Rick and Morty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2861424/) - An awesome animated series
